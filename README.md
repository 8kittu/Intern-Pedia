**Student Grade Calculator**
**Project Overview**
The Student Grade Calculator is a Python-based application that allows users to input marks for multiple subjects and calculates:

**Total Marks**
Average Percentage
Grade (based on a predefined grading scale)
This tool helps students quickly assess their overall performance across various subjects.

**Features**
Total Marks Calculation: Adds up the marks from all subjects entered.
Average Percentage Calculation: Computes the average percentage from the total marks and number of subjects.
Grade Determination: Assigns a grade based on the average percentage using the following scale:
A+: 90% and above
A: 80% - 89%
B+: 70% - 79%
B: 60% - 69%
C+: 50% - 59%
C: 40% - 49%
F: Below 40%
**Usage**
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
Run the Jupyter Notebook or execute the Python script from the command line.
**Running the Application**
Open the Jupyter Notebook (Student Grade Calculator.ipynb).
Run all the cells in sequence.
When prompted, input the number of subjects and enter the marks for each subject.
**The output will display:**

Total Marks: Sum of all entered marks.
Average Percentage: Average percentage based on total marks and number of subjects.
Grade: Assigned based on the calculated average.
**Example**
Enter the number of subjects:  5
Enter marks for subject 1 (out of 100):  99
Enter marks for subject 2 (out of 100):  89
Enter marks for subject 3 (out of 100):  75
Enter marks for subject 4 (out of 100):  95
Enter marks for subject 5 (out of 100):  92
**Output:**
Total Marks: 450
Average Percentage: 90.00%
Grade: A+
**Dependencies**
Python 3.6+
Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebook)
